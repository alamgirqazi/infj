Don’t feel like you’re inconveniencing people when you ask for help. It’s the right thing to do and they will understand. It’s okay to say no. Don’t waste your life worrying about the world’s problems. They’re not your fault and you can’t solve them yourself anyway. You are a sensitive one, and it is best to keep yourself out of situations or relationships where you will be overwhelmed or have your heart broken. Live in the moment occasionally. You’ll see how much more you enjoy experiences that way. Just be yourself and you will make friends, I promise you. Don’t waste your time trying to someone else, because you’ll see it doesn’t pay off in the long run. Find a job you love. This one goes for every personality type, but especially INFJs, you will not like life if you’re not passionate about what you’re doing. Try to see the big picture, but not too much. You have a tendency to be perfectionistic, and you’ll find the little details really don’t matter very much in the end. However, existential crises don’t really change your life, keep in mind. Whether or not everyone else’s brains are controlled by starfish, you still have to act like they’re people.</p>\n<p>(this was collected from quora)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"INFJ Tip 2","date":"March 23, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/tips/2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tips/3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"INFJ Tip 3"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tips/5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"INFJ Tip"}}}}
