Being in the world is very difficult. Existing is very difficult. I know you always look forward to running away from everything, from everyone, maybe from yourself. I know you are looking for something bigger, something beyond all what you know or everyone know. I know nothing will satisfy you in the dust and ashes of this world. So, dear, look for it. Always remember that you were gifted to see what is beyond, what is beyond the material, what is beyond the language, what is beyond the looks, the gestures, the laughs and tears of the people you meet. Look for that thing that is so deep in the core of your soul that you know could take you above and beyond this world. Always look for the meaning, always analyze and inhale the wisdom of your intuition. And love, love unconditionally, love until you find someone who can love you unconditionally, and you two can hold your hands and dream about eternity.</p>\n<p>But…</p>\n<p>Being in this world is very difficult, being in control is very difficult, being responsible of your enlightenment gift is very very difficult, that’s why sometimes you will screw things up, you will fail, you will be in conflict with yourself, your values, your aspirations of yourself, so don’t be sad, don’t be angry at yourself. It’s true that you are the prophet, the magician, the wise, but still you are a human, so always remember you are a human, you are not perfect, dear, you are trying, and you will be doing your best, and you will be rewarded for that, but sometimes you will just be weak and undetermined, and it’s OK. You will rise up again. Be patient, you are still very young, your existence is very young comparing to the age of the universe, so it takes time to learn, it takes time to be able to fix yourself, to fill the gaps and answer the difficult questions. To learn to love the world as well, to enjoy yourself with its joys, even the sensual ones, they are good as well, they are part of the experience, it’s OK to just let go and have fun from time to time, it is part of your individuation process. Love your self, dear. You really deserve to be loved. I know that from the bottom of my heart. And I love you.</p>\n<p>(this was collected from quora)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"INFJ Tip","date":"March 23, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/tips/5/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tips/2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"INFJ Tip 2"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tips/1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"INFJ Tip"}}}}
